# White Terminal Theme
Just my color scheme for my terminal.

![An image showing 4 terminal emulators running this white theme. First termial is running the command "top", just black and white. Second terminal running "htop", colorful and easily readable. Third terminal running the "ls" command on a directory. And final terminal running "vi/vim" on a C source code file.](https://github.com/xDahl/WhiteTerminalTheme/blob/main/theme.png?raw=true)

I decided to post this theme here, as I couldn't\
find any good white themes online (they're all so bad).\
And I didn't want to lose it if I change distro... again...\
White themes (when done right) are QUITE pleasant to use,\
and unlike dark themes, don't cause eye strain for me.\
I know, most people have it the other way around, which is\
fine, if you prefer dark themes, this theme isn't for you.

This color scheme is just a slight modification of the\
white terminal theme I found on Fedora 36/37.\
I am not sure what it's originally called.

I need to change the bright version of green a little,\
as it's a little too neon for my liking, too intense.\
I may fix up the yellows a bit too, but we'll see.
